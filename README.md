# ApiMap

Visual API mapping tool for development teams.

## The Problem

Development teams and agencies waste hours translating API documentation into UI specifications using messy spreadsheets. Teams struggle to track which API fields map to which UI components, leading to miscommunication and delayed project approvals.

## The Solution

ApiMap provides a visual interface where teams can map API endpoints to UI components, collaborate in real-time, and export specifications in multiple formats.

## Status

⚠️ **Extremely early development** - Just getting started. Expect nothing to work yet.

## Tech Stack

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Hotwire/Stimulus

More documentation coming as the project develops.
